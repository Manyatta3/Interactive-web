## ✨ Features

1. **Custom Form Validation**

   * Username must be at least 3 characters.
   * Email must match a valid pattern.
   * Password must be at least 6 characters.
   * Displays success/error messages below the form.

2. **Click Counter**

   * A button that counts and displays the number of times it has been clicked.

3. **Background Color Changer**

   * A button that changes the background color of the page to a random pastel shade.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

   * (Optional) Use a live server extension in VS Code for auto-reloading.

## 🖥️ Demo Walkthrough

* **Form Section** → Enter details, test invalid inputs, and see messages in red/green.
* **Counter Section** → Click the button and watch the number increase.
* **Color Changer Section** → Change the background color with a single click.

## 📌 Notes

* No external libraries are required.
* Works in all modern browsers.
* The form doesn’t submit to a server—validation is client-side only.
